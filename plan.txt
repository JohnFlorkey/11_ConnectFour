Step One
HTML
* The grid should be very well defined, probably a table
* The size of the cells could scale with the window, but the cells cannot flow onto other rows
* Use data attributes or classes to control white/red/blue
* Title/instructions

CSS
* Use classes to control white/red/blue
* Possibly some animation
* Provide a background

JS
* Determine the lowest unoccupied cell in a column
* Check for winning condition
* Set the class/attribute for color
* Dynamically setup the board
* Track the state of the gameboard 
    - a map may be a good structure for tracking gameboard state
    - {Column (0-6), Row (0-5), state (white/red/blue)}
* Flow
    - Setup/reset the board
    - Let players start the game
    - Announce player 1/2 turn
    - Player selects column for their move
    - Determine column selected from click event
    - Determine the lowest available row
        - Return message if no available row
        - Player selects again
    - Update the gameboard in memory
    - Update the gameboard visually
    - Check for win condition
    - announce win condition
    - No further moves can be made

Step 2
* Might be able to convert some of the for loops to foreach or for of
